#### Random quotes that I find insightful:
>The thing about the world is that it doesn't have any extra pieces. It's like pi: it contains everything. You remove a single piece, no circle. Your recklessness, your mistakes, are the reason why when they say, 'You can't change the world,' you won't listen.

-- Harold Finch in _Person of Interest_, "2πr"
